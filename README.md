Installation
============

Using Yarn 
------------

`git clone [HTTP-project-url]`
`yarn` then `yarn dev`

Dev-Reference
============

just hide some stuff in graph container unless click
giant editor

text editor id can be undefined
auto-complete doesn't always work
graph viewbox  container resize
view states


cancel selection mid way

So if in graph view, just focus the text 
if you autocomplete and then go in front of it and delete text there.
then a text node dispears
right click does stuff it shouldn't

- Pdf Text
  - highlight
  - autocomplete comments

- Links
  - make two links
  - delete a link and a viewbox at the same time
  - edit link text
  - render link text at center
  - some links nodes should be immutable

- Nodes
  - move many

- Viewbox
  - delete segment in pdf viewer

- Zoom
  - html-to-image
  
- Slate
  - 'a' things
  - outline + link creation

- Perf
  - react spring + transform + opacity
  - prevent pdf renders
  - add in a pdf with 37 pages and it's more like 200ms per dispatch, so
    need to prevent rerender of other svg pages

- Refactor
  - use attributes like id/ data- to prevent overlay events
