171,pagesOfTextToDisplay-1,5.432638863567263e-05,171,A given interaction could imply multiple transforms and multiple interactions might imply the same transform.
218,pagesOfTextToDisplay-1,5.254293864709325e-05,218,"Disconnects between the two might cause confusion [20], particularly when analysts try to interpret code-generated scripts."

43,pagesOfTextToDisplay-1,4.97177716169972e-05,43,These techniques enable analysts to rapidly navigate and assess the space of viable transforms.
385,pagesOfTextToDisplay-1,4.9544774810783565e-05,385,"Third, we rank transform types based on their corpus frequency, conditioned on their initiating user interaction (e.g., text or column selection)."

48,pagesOfTextToDisplay-1,4.6838111302349716e-05,48,We find that Wrangler significantly reduces specification time and promotes the use of robust transforms rather than manual editing.
